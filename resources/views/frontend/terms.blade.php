        <ul class="color-white">
            <li>The Client acknowledges the electronic nature of the Services and the inherent risk that communications by
                electronic means may not reach their intended destination or may do so much later than intended for reasons
                outside the Company’s control.</li>
            <li>Since the Company does not control signal power, its reception or routing via Internet or any other means of
                electronic communication, configuration of Client’s equipment or reliability of its connection, the Company

                directly or indirectly, by any breakdown or failure of any transmission or communication system or computer

            <li>The Client is obliged to keep all login information secret and ensure that third parties do not obtain
                access to the trading facilities. The Client will be held responsible for transactions executed by means of
                the Client’s password even if such transactions were not executed by the Client.</li>
            <li>Unless otherwise indicated or agreed any prices shown on the Company’s Trading Platform are indicative at
                the time shown based on data that is subject to constant change. The execution price is that which is

                the Execution Venue reserves the right to amend or revoke the details of the transaction(s) in question.

                kind in respect of any materials on any website which is not under the Company’s direct control.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><b class="color-white">Market Making</b></h3>
        <ul class="color-white">
            <li>The Client is specifically made aware that in certain markets, including the foreign exchange markets, OTC
                foreign exchange options and CFD Contracts, the Execution Venue may act as a Market Maker.</li>
            <li>The Company follows the STP execution model with all orders sent to Top Edges.</li>
            <li>The Company will, upon the Client’s written request, in general disclose to the Client whether the Company
                may act as a Market Maker in certain CFD Contracts.</li>
            <li>When acting as a Market Maker, the Execution Venue will under normal market circumstances quote the Client
                bid and ask prices.</li>
            <li>In order for the Company to quote prices with the swiftness normally associated with speculative trading,
                the Company may have to rely on available price or available information that may later prove to be faulty
                due to specific market circumstances, for instance, but not limited to, lack of liquidity in or suspension
                of an asset or errors in feeds from information providers or quotes from Counter-parties. If so and if the
                Company has acted in good faith when providing the price to the Client, the Company may cancel the trade
                with the Client but shall do so within reasonable time and shall provide the Client with a full explanation
                for the reason for such cancellation.</li>
            <li>Following execution of any position with a Client, the Execution Venue may at it’s reasonable discretion
                subsequently offset each such client position with another Client position, or a position with one of the
                Execution Venue’s Counter-parties or retain a proprietary position in the market with the intention to
                obtain trading profits from such positions. Such decisions and actions may therefore result in the Execution
                Venue offsetting client positions at prices different – sometimes significantly different – from prices
                quoted to Clients, resulting in trading profits or losses for the Execution Venue. This in turn can raise
                the possibility of the Client incurring what may be seen as an implied cost (i.e. the difference between the
                price at which the Client traded with the Execution Venue and the price at which the Execution Venue
                subsequently traded with Counter-parties and/ or other Clients) due to any profits realised by the Execution
                Venue as a result of the Market Making function. However the Market Making function may involve significant
                costs to the Execution Venue if the market moves against it as compared to the price at which it traded with
                the Client.</li>
            <li>The Client accepts that the Execution Venue in CFD contracts where it acts as Market Maker may hold
                positions that are contrary to positions of the Client, resulting in potential conflicts of interest between
                the Execution Venue and the Client.</li>
            <li>In markets, where the Execution Venue acts as a Market Maker, the Client accepts that the Company has no
                obligation to quote prices to clients at all times in any given market, nor to quote such prices to clients
                with a specific maximum spread.</li>
            <li>The Client acknowledges, recognises and accepts that the price quoted to the Client includes a spread when
                compared with the price to which the Execution Venue may have covered or expected to be able to cover the
                Contract in a trade with another client or a Counterparty. Furthermore, the Client acknowledges, recognises
                and accepts that said spread constitutes remuneration to the Company and that such spread can not
                necessarily be calculated for all Contracts and that such spread will not be specified at the Trade
                Confirmation or otherwise revealed to the Client.</li>
            <li>Any commission costs, interest charges, costs associated to and included in the spreads quoted by the
                Execution Venue as a Market Maker in certain markets and other fees and charges will consequently influence
                the Client’s trading result and will have a negative effect on the Client’s trading performance compared to
                a situation if such commission costs, interest charges, costs associated to and included in the spreads did
                not apply.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the case that the client account equity is equal or exceeds 300,000 USD (or currency equivalent) and
                    there are open trades of 50 lots or more, the Company reserves the right to adjust the leverage of the
                    underlying trading account to 1:75. If this is the case the Company will inform the Client by email.
                </li>
                <li>If the Client is an active trader and is undertaking numerous transactions, the total impact of visible
                    as well as not visible costs may be significant. Consequently the Client may have to obtain significant
                    profits in the markets in order to cover the costs associated with trading activities with the Execution
                    Venue. For very active Clients, such costs may over time exceed the value of the margin deposited.
                    Normally, when trading margined derivatives, the lower the percentage of the applicable margin rate, the
                    higher the proportion of the costs associated with executing a transaction. Margined derivatives are
                    derivatives such as CFD’s that can be traded using a leverage of higher than 1:1.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The Client is specifically made aware that in the area of market making in foreign exchange, OTC foreign
                exchange options, CFD Contracts and other OTC products, significant implied costs can arise as a consequence
                of the profits made by the Execution Venue performing in its capacity as a Market Maker.</li>
            <li>The Execution Venue’s performance as a Market Maker may negatively affect the Client’s Account with the
                Execution Venue and the said implied costs are neither directly visible nor directly quantifiable for the
                Client at any time.</li>
            <li>. The Execution Venue is at no time obliged to disclose any details of its performance or income produced as
                a Market Maker or otherwise related to other commissions, charges and fees.</li>
            <li>The Client is specifically made aware that CFD Contracts may be OTC products quoted by the Execution Venue
                whilst operating as a Market Maker and not traded on a recognised stock exchange. As a result, the
                description above of the implied, not visible costs related to the Execution Venue performance as a Market
                Maker may also apply to any CFD Contract.</li>
            <li>. Due to low liquidity and/or or high volatility and widened spreads, placing of pending orders around some
                Economic Announcements may be restricted.</li>
            <li>The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to delete any Pending Orders older than three (3)
                months from the Clients’ trading account(s). Pending Order is a “Buy Limit”, “Buy Stop”, “Sell Limit” or
                “Sell Stop” order, as per the Company’s Order Execution Policy. Note: All Pending Orders on Shares CFDs and
                Commodities CFDs will be automatically closed during market breaks. In case any orders on the aforementioned
                assets are left pending, they will be automatically deleted after the daily market closure time.</li>
        </ul>
